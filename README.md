# image_compressor

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

You should be met with a screen like this:

<img width="1793" height="1643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0e6238b-8a2b-490e-a600-b9d9faecf97f" />

Where you can drag'n'drop as many files to compress as you need.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

Host on any services which can deploy sveltekit projects!
